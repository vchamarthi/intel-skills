"""Select which skills SkillSpector should scan based on a git diff.

The SkillSpector per-skill matrix used to fan out over *every* skill on every
run, so a one-line edit to a single skill triggered a full re-scan of the whole
catalog. This script narrows the matrix to just the skills that actually
changed.

Behaviour:

  * Diff the working tree against ``--base`` and collect the changed paths.
  * If any *infra* path changed (this script, the SkillSpector workflow, the
    gate, the baseline or the SARIF merge), scan EVERY skill -- a change to the
    scanning machinery can affect the result for all skills.
  * Otherwise, scan only the skills with changes under ``skills/<name>/``.
  * Print the selected skill names as a compact JSON array (for a CI matrix).
    The array may be empty, in which case there is nothing to scan.

If the base ref is missing or unresolvable (a manual ``workflow_dispatch`` run,
a brand-new branch with no parent, a shallow checkout, ...), fall back to
scanning every skill so we never silently skip a scan.

Usage:

    uv run .github/scripts/changed_skills.py --base "$BASE_SHA"
    uv run .github/scripts/changed_skills.py --base origin/main --skills-dir skills
