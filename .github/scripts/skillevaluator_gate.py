"""Gate one skill's SkillEvaluator JSON report against .skillevaluator-baseline.yaml.

`skillevaluator validate` already has a verdict: it fails a skill on every finding a
validator counts as an error, on any scanner that did not complete, and on a quality
score below --min-score. What it has no way to express is an accepted finding. Its policy overlay remaps a *kind* of finding catalog-wide, keyed on
CATEGORY.check_name, and there is no baseline, fingerprint or per-file suppression. A
catalog with 23 imported skills needs one, because the repair for an imported body lands
upstream and arrives through a moved pin, and until then the finding is known and
reviewed rather than new.

So this script re-derives the verdict from the JSON with the baseline applied, and
nothing else:

  * every error-level finding must be matched by a `findings` entry scoped to this
    skill, or it fails. Error-level is SkillEvaluator's own call, read from the
    result's error list: every HIGH and CRITICAL, plus the MEDIUM findings a validator
    raises as errors (a Bandit MEDIUM at medium or high confidence, for one). Gating by
    severity alone would leave those failing with nothing a baseline entry could match;
  * every scanner in a result's `incomplete_scans` must be matched by an `incomplete`
    entry, or it fails -- an incomplete scan is no answer, and SkillEvaluator's own gate
    treats it as a failure too;
  * a result that failed with an error the findings do not account for (a validator that
    reported through its legacy error list rather than a finding) fails, because there
    is nothing structured to accept it by;
  * a quality score below --min-score fails. SkillEvaluator records that only as the
    QUALITY result's `passed`, with no finding or error behind it, so nothing else
    here would see it. It is not a baseline matter: the fix is in the skill;
  * a baseline entry scoped to this skill that matched nothing fails, so fixing a
    finding forces its acceptance out in the same pull request. The file is a ratchet.

Reading the JSON rather than trusting the exit code is also what separates a skill that
failed from a tool that did: SkillEvaluator raises its configuration errors (`--tiers`,
a conflicting `--profile`) as ClickException, which exits 1 exactly like a failed skill.
A missing or malformed report is therefore the tool failing, and is reported as that.

The report is also checked for the policy it ran under. A run that silently fell back to
the bare `external` profile would fail every skill on `SCHEMA.author_missing`, which reads
as 33 regressions rather than as one dropped flag.

Usage:

    uv run .github/scripts/skillevaluator_gate.py \\
        --report-dir reports/linux-perf --skill linux-perf --min-score 70 --annotate
    uv run .github/scripts/skillevaluator_gate.py --check-baseline

Exits 0 when the skill passes, 1 when it fails or the report cannot be trusted, and 2 on
a usage error or an unreadable baseline.
